Sure, here's how you can add the ability to rename and remove subjects:

1. First, add the buttons in the `EditorSubjectList` class:

```python
class EditorSubjectList:
    # ...

    def __init__(self, parent, callback, rename_callback, remove_callback, subject_list,
                 active_subject_list):
        # ...

        self.rename_callback = rename_callback
        self.remove_callback = remove_callback

        # ...

        # Add 'Remove Subject' and 'Rename Subject' buttons
        self.remove_button = tk.Button(parent, text='Remove Subject',
                                       command=self.remove_subject)
        self.remove_button.place(x=self.x + 40, y=self.y + 670)

        self.rename_button = tk.Button(parent, text='Rename Subject',
                                       command=self.rename_subject)
        self.rename_button.place(x=self.x + 150, y=self.y + 670)

    def remove_subject(self):
        selected_index = self.listbox.curselection()[0]
        selected_id = self.subject_ids[selected_index]
        self.remove_callback(selected_id)

    def rename_subject(self):
        selected_index = self.listbox.curselection()[0]
        selected_id = self.subject_ids[selected_index]
        self.rename_callback(selected_id)
```

2. Then, implement the `remove_subject` and `rename_subject` methods in the `EditorPage`
   class:

```python
class EditorPage(ttk.Frame):
    # ...

    def __init__(self, parent, controller):
        # ...

        self.listbox = EditorSubjectList(
            self.editor_canvas,
            self.configure_subject,
            self.rename_subject,
            self.remove_subject,
            self.controller.subjects,
            self.controller.active_subjects,
        )

    # ...

    def remove_subject(self, subject_id):
        subject = self.controller.get_subject(subject_id)
        if subject in self.controller.subjects:
            self.controller.subjects.remove(subject)
        elif subject in self.controller.active_subjects:
            self.controller.active_subjects.remove(subject)
        self.listbox.update_list()

    def rename_subject(self, subject_id):
        new_name = simpledialog.askstring("Input", "Enter new subject name:")
        subject = self.controller.get_subject(subject_id)
        subject.name = new_name
        self.listbox.update_list()
```

This code adds a 'Remove Subject' and a 'Rename Subject' button to
the `EditorSubjectList`. When a button is clicked, it gets the ID of the currently
selected subject and calls the appropriate callback function in the `EditorPage` class.

The `remove_subject` method in the `EditorPage` class removes the subject from
either `App.subjects` or `App.active_subjects`, and then updates the listbox.

The `rename_subject` method asks the user for a new name using a simple dialog, then
changes the subject's name and updates the listbox.

Note: The `simpledialog` module is part of tkinter and provides a way to get user input.
You'll need to import it at the top of your file:

```python
from tkinter import simpledialog
```

> This code starts all the timers:

   ```
       def start_timers(self):
           """
           Starts all the inactive timers on the page
           Marks each subject as active
           Disables the button to advance to the next section
           """
           for timer in self.timers:
               if not timer.is_running:
                   # Mark subjects as active
                   for subject in timer.subjects:
                       self.controller.active_subjects.append(subject)
                       if subject in self.controller.subjects:
                           self.controller.subjects.remove(subject)
                   timer.start_timer()
   
           self.controller.header.advance_button.configure(state="disabled")
   ```

To create a dialog that allows the user to choose some but not all timers to start, you
could use a `Toplevel` window with a `Checkbutton` for each timer. The user could check
or uncheck each `Checkbutton` to indicate whether they want that timer to start.

Here's an example of how you could create this dialog:

```python
class StartTimersDialog(tk.Toplevel):
   def __init__(self, parent, timers):
      super().__init__(parent)
      self.title("Start Timers")
      self.timers = timers

      # Create a Checkbutton for each timer
      self.check_vars = []
      for timer in timers:
         check_var = tk.BooleanVar(value=True)
         self.check_vars.append(check_var)
         check_button = tk.Checkbutton(self, text=str(timer), var=check_var)
         check_button.pack()

      # Create a button to start the selected timers
      start_button = tk.Button(self, text="Start", command=self.start_timers)
      start_button.pack()

   def start_timers(self):
      for timer, check_var in zip(self.timers, self.check_vars):
         if check_var.get():
            timer.start_timer()
      self.destroy()
```

Then, in your `TimerPage` class, you could create an instance of this dialog when the
user clicks the Start button:

```python
def on_start_button_click(self):
   StartTimersDialog(self, self.timers)
```

This will create a new window with a `Checkbutton` for each timer. The user can check or
uncheck each `Checkbutton` to indicate whether they want that timer to start. When they
click the Start button, all the selected timers will start, and the dialog will close.

As for your second question, if the user wanted to start only certain subjects, you
would indeed need to separate and regroup the timers to not include the subjects the
user does not want started. This would involve creating a similar dialog to the one
above, but with a `Checkbutton` for each subject instead of each timer. When the user
selects the subjects they want to start and clicks the Start button, you would need to
regroup the timers based on the selected subjects and then start those timers.

> Can you show me exactly how I can do the regrouping in my code? We would need to group

Yes, you're correct. To start only selected subjects, you would need to regroup the
timers based on the selected subjects and start those timers, then regroup the remaining
subjects without starting those timers.

This would require some changes to your current code, but they should not be too large.
The main change would be to modify `group_timers` to take a list of subjects as an
argument, and only group those subjects.

Here's an example of how you could modify `group_timers`:

```python
def group_timers(self, subjects_to_group):
   """
   Groups the given subjects' first section (that hasn't been run) by duration
   Creates a timer for each duration
   """
   sections_by_duration = defaultdict(list)

   for subject in subjects_to_group:
      for section in subject.sections:
         if not section.section_run:
            section.section_in_progress = True
            duration = timedelta(hours=section.hours, minutes=section.minutes)
            sections_by_duration[duration].append(subject)
            self.controller.active_subjects.append(subject)
            break

   # remove active subjects from subjects
   for subject in self.controller.active_subjects:
      if subject in self.controller.subjects:
         self.controller.subjects.remove(subject)

   # add a timer for each duration
   for duration in sorted(sections_by_duration.keys()):
      timer = Timer(
         self, self.finish, sections_by_duration[duration], duration, 0
      )
      self.timers.append(timer)
```

Then, in your dialog, you would get the selected subjects, call `group_timers` with
those subjects, start the timers, and then call `group_timers` again with the remaining
subjects.

As for your idea of having two tabs in the popup window, one for choosing the timer to
start and one for choosing individual subjects to start, that can indeed be done with
a `ttk.Notebook`. You would create two frames, one for each tab, and add them to the
notebook. Each frame would contain the UI for selecting the timers or subjects to start.

Here's a basic example of how you could create a notebook with two tabs:

```python
class StartDialog(tk.Toplevel):
   def __init__(self, parent):
      super().__init__(parent)
      self.title("Start Timers or Subjects")

      self.notebook = ttk.Notebook(self)

      self.timers_frame = ttk.Frame(self.notebook)
      self.subjects_frame = ttk.Frame(self.notebook)

      self.notebook.add(self.timers_frame, text="Timers")
      self.notebook.add(self.subjects_frame, text="Subjects")

      self.notebook.pack(expand=True, fill="both")
```

You would then add the UI for selecting the timers or subjects to the `timers_frame`
and `subjects_frame` respectively.
